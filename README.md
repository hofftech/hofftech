.grid-item-text The Field Of Heroes, a memorial in central Idaho, is a field of almost 7000 crosses, each one dedicated to a soldier who fell during the engagments in the Middle East.
.grid-item-text We built an app that generated individual QR codes that could be placed on each cross, and when scanned, would provide more information about that soldier.

.grid-item-text Games!
.grid-item-text I love making games.
.grid-item-text "Video games are the sum total of every expressive medium of all time, made interactive."
.grid-item-text I'm a big fan of games that showcase new mechanics; it's easy to juice and polish a game, but it's really something else to make a game that <i>feels</i> good.

	We all grew up watching science fiction. *Tron*, *The Fifth Element* and *The Next Generation* basically shaped our childhoods.

	These worlds....something something. It was mysterious and alluring, and it made us feel like technology could make the world a better place.

	We still think it can.

	something about technology -> social good

	We're not glorified toymakers. We don't create trivial nothings that cater only to the rich and privileged.

	That's not to say that we don't make toys. When we do, they're simple, accessible, and delightful.

	something about bringing high-tech to the masses, improving lives -->
