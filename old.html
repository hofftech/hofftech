I like simple, clean web apps that are fast, look nice, and get the job done. </p><p>I'll sit down with you, face-to-face or over video chat, for as long as you like. I'll work through your problem with you, and explore every possible interaction, configuration, and edge case.</p><p>I'll discover and interview your users and customers. I'll find out about their lives, their problems, what they love and what keeps them up at night. I'll make them mockups, and prototypes, and experiment on them over and over and over again until I find something that they never ever want to give up.</p><p class="callout">And then, I'll build the thing right. </p><div id="cta"><p>Get in touch.</p><a href="mailto:ken@hoff.technology" target="_blank">ken@hoff.technology</a></div></div></body></html>
