# Field of Heroes

## Summary

The Field Of Heroes, a memorial in Central Ohio, is a field of almost 7000 crosses, each one dedicated to a soldier who fell during the engagments in the Middle East. We built an app that generated individual QR codes that could be placed on each cross, and when scanned, would provide more information about that soldier.
