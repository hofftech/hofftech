				.grid-item-text Games!
				.grid-item-text I love making games. 
				.grid-item-text "Video games are the sum total of every expressive medium of all time, made interactive." 
				.grid-item-text I'm a big fan of games that showcase new mechanics; it's easy to juice and polish a game, but it's really something else to make a game that <i>feels</i> good.
