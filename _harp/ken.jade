				p Hi there! I'm Ken.
				p I'm a web developer and designer.
				p I'm originally from Boulder, CO, but I'm currently based out of Seattle, WA.
				p I'm a big fan of biking, cooking, and annoying my adorably dumb cat with the ukulele.
				p I've worked at Microsoft, as well as a number of startups.
				p I primarily work in Node.js, React, and RethinkDB.
				p Hit me up at <a href="mailto: ken@hoff.tech">ken@hoff.tech</a>.
